## C#
C# was created by Microsoft as a rival to Java, because Sun did not want Microsoft to make changes to Java, so Microsoft chose to create their own language instead. Microsoft needed an object oriented programming language to support the .NET framework. Early year of C# was very similar to Java, now Java and C# began to diverge as they implemented different features in different ways.
