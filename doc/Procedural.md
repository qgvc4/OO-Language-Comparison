# Procedural programming
* Does the language support procedural programming?


## C#



## Swift

Procedural means structured. The original programming languages were procedural. For OOP, the language needs to be procedural. As we see, procedural (or imperative) programming is primarily concerned with decomposing problems into a sequence of actions. The data tends to be highly decoupled from the functions that operate on it. For some applications, this can be an advantage for the design.

More specifically, the code can be procedural except the beginning as:
```Swift
class DateApp {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        fun1();
        fun2();
        fun3();
        fun4();
        fun5();
	â€¦
    }
}
```
Everything else done by this app can be written in pure procedural programming.
