# Name Spaces
* How are name spaces implemented?
* How are name spaces used?


## C#


## Swift
In Swift, we can have the same name for a class if they come from two different namespace (There is no namespcae in Objective-C, which is always being criticized by developers). 

However, it is not the same as C#, in which namespace is declared explicitly and containing additional code with braces. 

“Namespacing is implicit in Swift, all classes (etc) are implicitly scoped by the module (XCode target) they are in. no class prefixes needed” – Chris Lattner, developer of Swift
